        <p class="text">Rainis was also socially active and politically prominent, being one of the national leaders of the Revolution of 1905 in Latvia and the New Current that foreshadowed it. With the failure of the Revolution, he emigrated to Switzerland together with his wife Aspazija, settling in Castagnola, a suburb of Lugano. As an émigré, Rainis wrote:</p>
            <ul class="list list--unordered">
                <li>plays — Zelta Zirgs (The Golden Horse) (translated to English 2012), Jāzeps un viņa brāļi (Joseph and His Brothers), Spēlēju, dancoju (I Played, I Danced), Daugava (The Daugava, 1916), and Ģirts Vilks;</li>
                <li>poetry — Klusā grāmata (The Quiet Book), Vēja nesta lapas (Leaves Upon the Wind), Tie, kas neaizmirst (Those, Who Do Not Forget), Gals un sākums (The End and the Beginning), Ave sol, and Sveika, brīvā Latvija (Hello, Free Latvia).</li>
            </ul>
        <p class="text">His dramatic ballad Daugava contained the first explicit demand for Latvian sovereignty:</p>
        <p class="text"><span>"Land, land, what is that land demanded in our song? Land, that is a state."</span></p>
        <p class="text">Those lines were removed by the censor when the work was first published in Moscow. After the defeat of Bermondt-Avalov's forces at Riga in November 1919, the ballad was given a performance at the National Theater to mark the first anniversary of Latvia's proclamation of independence; many soldiers carried this work into battle.</p>
        <p class="text">"Zelta Zirgs" ("The Golden Horse") was translated to English in 2012 by Vilis Inde.</p>
        <p class="text">During his exile, Rainis published several more works, such as Gals un sākums (or "End and Beginning" in English, published 1912). These works used political and revolutionary symbolism and also borrow ideas from Hegelian philosophy. He also penned plays which linked Latvian folklore to the country's modern, political struggles.</p>
